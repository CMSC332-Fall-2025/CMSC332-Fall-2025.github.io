## Course Details 

### Welcome to Computer Networks!

Your dedication and hard work have led you to this moment; you belong here. Congratulations on your achievements, and welcome to the course. I am thrilled to have you here and am looking forward to a semester filled with growth, learning, and success. Together, we will explore, create, and innovate. Let's make this an outstanding semester for everyone!

### Course Description

This is a one unit course on computer networks. 
These networks, and in particular the Internet, 
are fundamental to our everyday lives. Whether for enabling global scale
commerce or connecting long lost friends, these systems have created
an unparalleled age of information. Accordingly, knowledge of such
systems is critical for all scientists and engineers. This course
provides an overview of networking technologies. Students
satisfactorily completing this course will gain the skills necessary
to analyze and design networking systems and protocols. The course
will begin with the application layer, looking at design patterns
present in common application layer protocols. We then move down the
network stack, considering topics such as reliable transmission and
congestion control at the transport layer, routing at the network
layer, and multiple access protocols at the link layer. After this
discussion, the latter portion of the course will include
wireless/mobile networks and devices, cellular networks, queuing fundamentals, security,
network management, and time permitting, other current topics in networks


### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, you will:

- Have an understanding of the problems that arise when a large number of computers is to be
interconnected for comminication purposes
- Have an understanding of what network protocols are, as well as the complexities of such
algorithms that arise because of the unique domain that computer networks presents
- Be familiar with the protocols that govern the Internet
- Have an understanding of *why* the protocols are designed as they are (including the fundamental design principles and how they have continued to evolve)
- Gain an understanding of the factors that influence network performance, as well as the measures used to measure that performance
- Gain an understanding of how the theory of networks are limited by the practical realities of deployed systems 
- Gain experience writing low level network code using the sockets API
 


### Course Topics 

Topics covered include (but are not limited to):

- Introduction to computer networks -- what are the problems, what are the building blocks, how are they arranged
- The application layer, and consideration of specific application programs 
- The transport layer
- The networks layer (data plane and control plane)
- The Data link layer (and various data link networks)
- Mobile networking
- Whatever interesting network topics we may have time for

## Prerequisite

The pre-requisite for this course is CMSC 301, completed with a grade of C- or better, or permission of the instructor.

 
## Textbook and Resources

### Textbook

- [Computer Networking: A Top Down Approach] (8th Edition), by Kurose and Ross	

- [TCP/IP Sockets in C] (Second Edition), by Donahoo and Calvert.  Note that the first edition had
a different title, so if you have a text with this title, it's the second edition, even if it does not
say so.

### Resources

- The RFC-Editor portal (https://www.rfc-editor.org/) You likely don't know what 
this is right now, but you will soon. 

## Coursework and Grading

I am still considering this.  Why?  Because traditional grading schemes
have been shown to be counterproductive.  The goal in any course should
be to learn, not to game the system so that you earn the highest grade.
Traditional grading incentivizes the wrong things.  So, with regards to
course work, below is what I know.  We'll discuss this again soon.

### Course Work
- There will be two midterm exams, and one final.  With the exception of the 
final, you will have the opportunity to earn back a portion of the points you 
lose on an exam.  Exam questions will be graded as follows: If you show a complete
understanding of the issue, you will receive a satisfactory mark.  If there is 
some understanding, but minor errors, you will earn a "needs minor revision", which
you will have the opportunity to improve.  If your solution shows a serious misunderstanding,
you will earn a "needs major revision".  Again, you will have the opportunity to 
improve that.  There will be no partial credit.  You will receive credit only
for those problems for which you earn a satisfactory mark.   Because the midterms are
take home exams, I reserve the right to grade some problems via an individual session
in which I ask you to work through problems. 

- There will be four programming projects.  These will be graded the same way, but because
these are not "timed" like exams are, once the deadline has passed, you will not longer have
the opportunity to improve your grade.  Instead, you will have the opportunity to show me
in office hours what your program is doing (or not doing) so that we can discuss where the
issues might be.  

- There may be a few labs, though I am not yet certain I will do that.  

- There will be a few homework assignments that will not be graded.  But you will need
to be able to solve these problems if you wish to do well on the exams.

- For each assignment (and in fact for each exam), I will be discussing the learning
goals that I am attempting to assess.

This is the first time I have used this grading system, so there will be some bumps in the 
road.  Please bear with me on that.

The final grade for the course must, of course, be a grade.  It will be determined
according to which learning outcomes you have met.  I have yet to completely work them
out, but I will have them worked out soon (and may still be tweaking things during
the semester). 

### Programming Expectations

Though the course is not programming intensive (as with, say, CMSC 240), there are three programming assignments. 
These must be completed using the Java programming language. 

You are expected to submit well-written code:

- Comments must be substantive.
- Choose descriptive and readable variable names and method names.
- Use consistent (and reasonable) indentation.
- Submit code that compiles.
  - Additionally, your code should be compiled in a standard, pre-described way for the class (e.g., using javac in the VSCode terminal command line).

You are also expected to be able to describe and answer questions about your code when prompted.

### Late Work Policy

Non-exam assignments may be submitted late with a **10%** deduction **per day** late, up to a maximum of four days late. 

You will have two "**late passes**" per semester to use on homework and the programming assignments.  To use a late pass, notify me which assignment you would like to use it on, and you may turn that assignment in **one week late for full credit**. 

Late passes may **not** be used on the final or midterm exams.   

In cases of personal illnesses, emergencies, or documented accommodations, assignments may be submitted late for full credit if you notify me of your situation.


### Attendance Policy
Regular attendance for the entire class time is expected. You should not miss more than 4 total sessions (including lecture and lab). If you have to quarantine due to COVID or miss class for other legitimate reasons you will not be penalized.
   

### Homework

Homnework assignments will be distributed on Fridays, and are typically due the following Thursday at midnight.  There are some assignments which will require a second week, in which case I will make this change to the due time explicit.  Unlike other many other CS courses, the homework problems require a good amount of time for thinking prior to making any headway.  For this reason, it is strongly recommended that you begin homework assignments soon after you receive them.  Waiting until the day before they are due is a recipe for disaster (and garners no sympathy from me). projects, so might require two weeks to complete. In that case I will explicitly inform you of this. 

All programming projects will be distributed in repositories you will receive via Github Classroom.  (If 
you are unfamiliar with git or github classroom, I am happy to help walk you through the process.) Each homework
assignment will be distributed in the form of a LaTeX file.  You are expected to modify the LaTeX file by adding your problem solutions, and then compiling the LaTeX to a pdf file, which should be placed in your homework repository.  I am happy to answer questions related to how to prepare documents using LaTeX.  There are many document preparation environments that are appropriate for LaTeX, but for this course I expect you to use Overleaf. A major advantage of Overleaf it is a uniform environment in which you can share your LaTeX files with me.  

 
### Programming Assignments

Programming assignments, as mentioned above, must be coded using the Java programming language.  I will provide details regarding specifics of the coding environment shortly. 


## Class Communication

I will use two primary forms of communication in this class: email announcements and Slack. You are responsible for remaining up to date on any information sent by email or posted to Slack. This may include clarifications to assignments, updates on grading rubrics, and changes in office hours. 

For all general course information, questions, and clarifications, please use Slack. I hope that the Slack workspace can be an extension of our classroom community where we can share questions and answers for the entire class to view and learn from.

If you have personal, individual issues you'd like addressed, you should send those by email to me. However, all course related topics should be directed to Slack.


## Course Policies

### Illness policy

If you are ill and it will cause you to miss class, lab, or an assignment, you should let me know in advance, if possible. It is your responsibility to catch up with any missed material if you are able to do so.  If not, then immediately on return, work out a time-frame with me on when work will be submitted. 


### Academic Integrity policy

It is very important in this course (and in life), that your work be your own. These guidelines will help you achieve that.

You must:

- Do your best to solve all homework, projects, labs, and exams on your own.
- Write the names of any students you collaborated with as a comment at the top of your file (subject to the constraints below).

You may:

- Discuss general approaches to solving the homework problems with other students, but the pen-to-paper, fingers-to-keyboard work should be your own. 
- Have another student look at a specific snippet of your code (e.g., 10 lines) to help you debug a programming error.

You may not:

- Copy code to or from other students or people outside of the class.
- Have someone else write code for you.
- Copy code from the internet, unless you specifically reference the source and can explain how it works. This should be a tiny minority of the code you submit.
- Write code as a group and then submit identical or slightly modified versions---if you discuss general approaches to solving a problem together, you still must be writing up your own independent solution.

The [Honor Code](https://studentdevelopment.richmond.edu/student-handbook/honor/Honor-Code-January-2023.pdf) will apply to this course. Please read through the code carefully.



### Generative AI

You will almost certainly be using generative AI in some way for the rest of your career. You may use generative AI tools for homework and programming projects in the following manner.

You must: 
- Understand any code that you use. I reserve the right to review your submitted code with you, and ask you to explain how it works. 

You may:
- Ask a GenAI tool a generic question for informational purposes. For example, "Please explain the Java syntax for reading input from a file, and give an example."  If you use this code, please cite the source in a comment.

You may not:
- Ask a GenAI tool to solve the assignment.  For example, you should not paste the entire problem description and ask the GenAI to solve it for you.
- No GenAI tools can be used for the exams.

This policy is subject to change as we all learn more about how GenAI works and doesn’t work as part of learning college level course content.



### Disability Services 

Any student who may need an accommodation based on the potential impact of a disability should contact [Disability Services](https://disability.richmond.edu/) (or call 804-662-5001) to establish eligibility and to coordinate reasonable accommodations. 

If you are approved for classroom and/or testing accommodation(s) please make sure to submit a Disability Accommodation Notice to me at this [link](https://disabilityportal.richmond.edu/ClockWork/user/selfregC/courses.aspx).


## Wellness

If any issue arises that may limit your ability to participate in class, for example, personal illness, family emergency, etc., please be sure to discuss these matters with me as soon as possible and accommodations will be made available to you as appropriate.

Feelings of being overwhelmed are unfortunately quite common in the university environment. You are not alone, and there are a number of resources available to provide support in those moments. Learning to ask for help is an important part of the university experience, and if you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings of anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. UR offers counseling services, and also consider reaching out to a friend, family or faculty member you trust for help.
