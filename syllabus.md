## Course Details 

### Welcome to Algorithms!

Your dedication and hard work have led you to this moment; you belong here. Congratulations on your achievements, and welcome to the course. I am thrilled to have you here and am looking forward to a semester filled with growth, learning, and success. Together, we will explore, create, and innovate. Let's make this an outstanding semester for everyone!

### Course Description

This is a one unit course on computer algorithms. We will discuss and participate in the design and analysis of 
algorithms (and sometimes their associated data structures). This is among other things a course in advanced problem solving.  Algorithms will be motivated by examples from several application domains, including (but not limited to) operating systems, compilers, machine learning, networks, security, bioinformatics, graphics, and computational geometry.  Some topics will not be revealed in advance, but instead will be revealed at the time they are covered so that you are able to have a true problem solving experience. (In English: If you read about some of these topics beforehand, then you're not really solving the problem but instead just repeating the solution). 

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, you will:

- Have something of a roadmap to guide you in how to solve problems, as well as a "toolkit" of fundamental problem solving strategies
- Be comfortable with analyzing the runtime and memory requirements of algorithms
- Be comfortable with proving assertions of runtime and memory usage
- Understand practical and theoretical limits to which problems can be solved, as well as strategies to employ when efficient solutions don't appear to be possible 
- Gain an understanding of the proper ways to think about classes of problems
- Be comfortable with using and creating LaTeX documents

## Textbook and Resources

### Textbook

Algorithms, by S. Dasgupta, C. Papadimitriou, and U. Vazirani
	
Free pdf copies of this text can be found on the Internet.  You will also be able to find parts of the answer key for the problems in the text.	Though I will not be assigning those problems, they can make for good practice for exams. 

- [Algorithms], by Sanjoy Dasgupta, Christos Papadimitriou, and Umesh Vazirani


### Resources

The following book is **not required** for this course, bit it is the book I used for previous instances of the course, and the book associated with some of the slides I use in class. 

- [Algorithm Design and Applications] by Michael Goodrich and Roberto Tamassia

## Coursework and Grading

### Course Work
- Homework (Appx. 10 of these)
- Three programming assignments
- 2 take-home midterm exams 
  - First distributed February 13, due February 20
  - Second distributed April 1, due April 11
- Take-home final exam, distributed Friday, April 24, due Thursday, April 30, at 5:00 p.m.


### Grading Breakdown
   * 50%: Homework average
   * 20%: Programming assignments
   * 10%: Each midterm
   * 10%: Final exam


### Programming Expectations

Though the course is not programming intensive (as with, say, CMSC 240), there are three programming assignments. 
These must be completed using the Java programming language. 

You are expected to submit well-written code:

- Comments must be substantive.
- Choose descriptive and readable variable names and method names.
- Use consistent (and reasonable) indentation.
- Submit code that compiles.
  - Additionally, your code should be compiled in a standard, pre-described way for the class (e.g., using javac in the VSCode terminal command line).

You are also expected to be able to describe and answer questions about your code when prompted.

### Late Work Policy

Non-exam assignments may be submitted late with a **10%** deduction **per day** late, up to a maximum of four days late. 

You will have two "**late passes**" per semester to use on homework and the programming assignments.  To use a late pass, notify me which assignment you would like to use it on, and you may turn that assignment in **one week late for full credit**. 

Late passes may **not** be used on the final or midterm exams.   

In cases of personal illnesses, emergencies, or documented accommodations, assignments may be submitted late for full credit if you notify me of your situation.


### Attendance Policy
Regular attendance for the entire class time is expected. You should not miss more than 4 total sessions (including lecture and lab). If you have to quarantine due to COVID or miss class for other legitimate reasons you will not be penalized.
   

### Homework

Homnework assignments will be distributed on Fridays, and are typically due the following Thursday at midnight.  There are some assignments which will require a second week, in which case I will make this change to the due time explicit.  Unlike other many other CS courses, the homework problems require a good amount of time for thinking prior to making any headway.  For this reason, it is strongly recommended that you begin homework assignments soon after you receive them.  Waiting until the day before they are due is a recipe for disaster (and garners no sympathy from me). projects, so might require two weeks to complete. In that case I will explicitly inform you of this. 

All programming projects will be distributed in repositories you will receive via Github Classroom.  (If 
you are unfamiliar with git or github classroom, I am happy to help walk you through the process.) Each homework
assignment will be distributed in the form of a LaTeX file.  You are expected to modify the LaTeX file by adding your problem solutions, and then compiling the LaTeX to a pdf file, which should be placed in your homework repository.  I am happy to answer questions related to how to prepare documents using LaTeX.  There are many document preparation environments that are appropriate for LaTeX, but for this course I expect you to use Overleaf. A major advantage of Overleaf it is a uniform environment in which you can share your LaTeX files with me.  

 
### Programming Assignments

Programming assignments, as mentioned above, must be coded using the Java programming language.  I will provide details regarding specifics of the coding environment shortly. 


## Class Communication

I will use two primary forms of communication in this class: email announcements and Slack. You are responsible for remaining up to date on any information sent by email or posted to Slack. This may include clarifications to assignments, updates on grading rubrics, and changes in office hours. 

For all general course information, questions, and clarifications, please use Slack. I hope that the Slack workspace can be an extension of our classroom community where we can share questions and answers for the entire class to view and learn from.

If you have personal, individual issues you'd like addressed, you should send those by email to me. However, all course related topics should be directed to Slack.


## Course Policies

### Illness policy

If you are ill and it will cause you to miss class, lab, or an assignment, you should let me know in advance, if possible. It is your responsibility to catch up with any missed material if you are able to do so.  If not, then immediately on return, work out a time-frame with me on when work will be submitted. 


### Academic Integrity policy

It is very important in this course (and in life), that your work be your own. These guidelines will help you achieve that.

You must:

- Do your best to solve all homework, projects, labs, and exams on your own.
- Write the names of any students you collaborated with as a comment at the top of your file (subject to the constraints below).

You may:

- Discuss general approaches to solving the homework problems with other students, but the pen-to-paper, fingers-to-keyboard work should be your own. 
- Have another student look at a specific snippet of your code (e.g., 10 lines) to help you debug a programming error.

You may not:

- Copy code to or from other students or people outside of the class.
- Have someone else write code for you.
- Copy code from the internet, unless you specifically reference the source and can explain how it works. This should be a tiny minority of the code you submit.
- Write code as a group and then submit identical or slightly modified versions---if you discuss general approaches to solving a problem together, you still must be writing up your own independent solution.

The [Honor Code](https://studentdevelopment.richmond.edu/student-handbook/honor/Honor-Code-January-2023.pdf) will apply to this course. Please read through the code carefully.



### Generative AI

You will almost certainly be using generative AI in some way for the rest of your career. You may use generative AI tools for homework and programming projects in the following manner.

You must: 
- Understand any code that you use. I reserve the right to review your submitted code with you, and ask you to explain how it works. 

You may:
- Ask a GenAI tool a generic question for informational purposes. For example, "Please explain the Java syntax for reading input from a file, and give an example."  If you use this code, please cite the source in a comment.

You may not:
- Ask a GenAI tool to solve the assignment.  For example, you should not paste the entire problem description and ask the GenAI to solve it for you.
- No GenAI tools can be used for the exams.

This policy is subject to change as we all learn more about how GenAI works and doesn’t work as part of learning college level course content.



### Disability Services 

Any student who may need an accommodation based on the potential impact of a disability should contact [Disability Services](https://disability.richmond.edu/) (or call 804-662-5001) to establish eligibility and to coordinate reasonable accommodations. 

If you are approved for classroom and/or testing accommodation(s) please make sure to submit a Disability Accommodation Notice to me at this [link](https://disabilityportal.richmond.edu/ClockWork/user/selfregC/courses.aspx).


## Wellness

If any issue arises that may limit your ability to participate in class, for example, personal illness, family emergency, etc., please be sure to discuss these matters with me as soon as possible and accommodations will be made available to you as appropriate.

Feelings of being overwhelmed are unfortunately quite common in the university environment. You are not alone, and there are a number of resources available to provide support in those moments. Learning to ask for help is an important part of the university experience, and if you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings of anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. UR offers counseling services, and also consider reaching out to a friend, family or faculty member you trust for help.
