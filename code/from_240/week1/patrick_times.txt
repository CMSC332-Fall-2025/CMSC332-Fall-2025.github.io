patrick:

To help with scheduling, I am in class MW 12-1pm and lab Thursday 1-3pm. My Monday, Thursday and Friday mornings (~8-11am) are usually open. My Friday afternoons are also usually open - I can move student meetings if needed. I also have time to schedule something on Tuesdays between 1-4pm.


Carol:

HI Doug,
Right now, am free at these times:
Wed 10-10:30, 12-2, 3-4
Thurs – anytime except 11-12
Fri – likely anytime, although after 1 would be best.


Yucong:

My Tuesday and Friday are most available. Besides that, I’m also free Thursday before 2pm and Wednesday after 3pm. Next Monday at/after 4 could also work.

Shweta:

Sure, I am available to meet anytime between 8:30 AM-11 AM tomorrow and after 2 PM on Thursday, and Friday.


Tim: 

Pretty much anytime on Wednesday afternoon is great. Thursday between 10 and noon and then again between 12:30 and 2 is good. And then late morning and afternoon on Friday isn’t bad either. Thanks! Good to get the band back together.

Prateek:  Friday at 2:00?
